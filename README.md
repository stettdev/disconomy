![GitHub tag main](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/stettdev/disconomy?label=main) ![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/stettdev/disconomy)

A Discord bot created for administrators of RP servers to provide them with a playable economy with bank accounts, shops and payments. It's focused on the role-playing aspect of the server rather than mechanical gaming and grind - it's flexible and easy to use for less knowledgeable players.

## **Technologies**

[![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/javascript-ES2021-f7df1e?logo=javascript&logoColor=fff)](https://www.nodejs.org/) [![Node.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/node.js-16.13.1-3C873A?logo=node.js&logoColor=fff)](https://www.nodejs.org/) [![Discord.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/discord.js-v13-738ADB?logo=discord&logoColor=fff)](https://www.nodejs.org/)

JavaScript and Node.js seemed to be the best choice due to previous experience developing in these technologies. Discord.js is a well-written module with vast and clear documentation which allowed understanding it and writing suitable code.

This was the first-time use of Sequelize in a project. It's a surprisingly complex ORM for SQL database solutions but the documentation explains everything well and the project was developed rather quickly using it.

## **Setup**

* [Invite](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=925136385290153984&permissions=274877908992&scope=applications.commands%20bot) the bot to your server. It will display which permissions are required for it to work.
* Once it arrives, you can configure initial settings via [commands](#setup-commands). User is required to have Administrator permissions to set up the bot.
